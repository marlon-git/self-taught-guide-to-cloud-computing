# Topic 2: Cloud CLI setup

Now we're going to setup your cloud environment. Make sure you've created an account with any of our supported clouds: AWS, Azure, or GCP.

- Action: Create an account with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/resources/create-account/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free)

Once you have an account, you need to get familiar with the cloud console of your selected cloud provider.

- Action: Getting Started with the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/getting-started-with-aws-management-console/) or [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview) or [GCP Console](https://cloud.google.com/console)

You should be a little familiar with your cloud console now. You can of course deploy things by clicking but we would rather you use the CLI.

- Study: [Why use a CLI](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/why-use-cli)
- Action: Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) or [GCP CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## CLI concepts you should know

- What is a CLI?
- The benefits of using a CLI vs a UI for cloud resource management.
- You created a cloud account.
- You installed a cloud cli.
- You configured the cloud cli with your account.

Great, when you're ready, move on to [Infrastructure as Code](3-iac.md).
