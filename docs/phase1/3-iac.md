# Topic 3: Infrastructure as Code

We will spend a lot more time on Infrastructure as Code and other DevOps practices later as all of our labs use them. For now I need you to familiarize yourself with a few Terraform (an infrastructure as code tool) concepts:

- Study: [What is IaC](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)
- Study: [What is Infrastructure as Code with Terraform?](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code)
- Study: [Terraform init](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init)
- Study: [Terraform apply](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply)
- Action: Use an AI assistant to test your understanding of the concepts. You can use this prompt as a template:

    ``` txt
    I'm studying cloud engineering and recently learned about Infrastructure as Code. I will provide you an explanation about it and please ask me any questions if my explanation is not clear. I want to make sure I really understand this concept so please do not correct me, simple ask questions until I get the explanation right. Here is my explanation: IaC is 
    ```

Finally we need to make sure Terraform is installed

- Action: [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install). For Windows users make sure you're installing it inside Ubuntu via WSL.

## Terraform concepts you should know

- What is Infrastructure as Code?
- What is Terraform?
- Why use Terraform?
- Terraform should be installed on your computer
- What does terraform init do?
- What does terraform apply do?

Great, when you're ready, move on to [Build and access the lab](4-ssh.md)
